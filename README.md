Keyviz is a free and open-source software to visualize your ‚å®Ô∏è keystrokes in realtime! Let your audience know what handy shortcuts/keys you're pressing during screencasts, presentations, collaborations, or whenever you need it.

## ü¶Ñ Style

Don't restrain yourself to just black & white! Change the visualization's style, size, color (modifier and normal keys), border, icon, and symbols.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fully Customizable

Powerful and easy to use configuration options. 
- Filter normal keys and only display shortcuts like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>
- Adjust visualization position on the screen
- Decide for how much the visualization lingers on the screen before animating out
- Switch between animation presets to animate your visualization in & out

If you're getting a `.dll` missing error after installing the application, then you're missing the requried Visual C++ redistributables. You can get the same from here [VSC++ Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).
