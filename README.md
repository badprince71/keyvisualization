Keyviz is a free and open-source software to visualise your ‚å®Ô∏è keystrokes in real time! Let your audience know what handy shortcuts/keys you're pressing during screencasts, presentations, collaborations, or whenever you need it.

## ü¶Ñ Style
![multiple-styles](previews/multiple-styles.png)

Don't restrain yourself to just black & white! Change the visualisation's style, size, colour (modifier and regular keys), border, icon, and symbols.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fully Customizable

Powerful and easy-to-use configuration options. 
- Filter normal keys and only display shortcuts like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>
- Adjust the visualisation position on the screen
- Decide how much the visualisation lingers on the screen before animating out
- Switch between animation presets to animate your visualisation in & out

# Installation
You can download the latest version of keyviz from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/mulaRahul/keyviz/releases) page. For the installer, unzip the downloaded file, run the installer and follow the familiar steps to install keyviz.

Or, install keyviz using [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/):
```powershell
winget install mulaRahul.Keyviz
```

Or from [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):
```powershell
scoop bucket add extras # first, add the bucket
scoop install keyviz
```

Alternatively, you can get the portable version which doesn't require installation but may or may not work on every system.

# Quickstart
You can also check out this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/FwuTqWzlRSc).

Follow the above [installation](#installation) process to start. Then, you can start visualising your keystrokes by just running the application.

To open the settings window, find the keyviz icon on the right side of the **Taskbar** or **Taskbar > Hidden Icons <kbd>^</kbd>**. Then right-click on the icon and select **Settings**. 

The settings window will appear, from which you customise the style, appearance, and other general visualisation settings. You can also pause the visualisations temporarily by left-clicking on the tray icon.

## `*.dll` Missing Error?

If you're getting a `.dll` missing error after installing the application, you're missing the required Visual C++ redistributables. You can get the same from here [VSC++ Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).
