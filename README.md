![keyviz-2.0](previews/banner.svg)

Keyviz is a free and open-source software to visualise your keystrokes and mouse actions in real time! Let your audience know what handy shortcuts/keys you're pressing during screencasts, presentations, collaborations, or whenever you need it.

# ‚å®Ô∏è Keystrokes & üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Actions

Now you can visualize mouse actions! Not only mouse clicks, you can also visualize mouse actions along with keystrokes like <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Click</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Drag</kbd>, etc.

# üé® Stylize

Don't restrain yourself to just black & white! You can customize every aspect of the visualization. The visualisation's style, size, colour (modifier and regular keys), border, icon, etc.

Powerful and easy-to-use configuration options.

- Filter normal keys and only display shortcuts like <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> **(Default)**
- Adjust the visualisation position on the screen
- Decide how much the visualisation lingers on the screen before animating out
- Switch between animation presets to animate your visualisation in & out

  If you're getting a `.dll` missing error after installing the application, you're missing the required Visual C++ redistributables. You can get the same from here [VSC++ Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

# üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

You can always further develop/build the project by yourself. First of all ensure that you've setup Flutter on your system. If not follow this [guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

After setting up flutter, clone the repository or download the zip and unpack the same.

```bash
mkdir keyviz
git clone https://github.com/mulaRahul/keyviz.git .
```

Move inside the flutter project and run the build command to create an executable -

```bash
cd keyviz
# get required dependencies
flutter pub get
# build executable
flutter build windows
```
